* finally we analyzed a dataset containing employees' absences and their relationship to additional health and socially related factors. We introduced various data analysis techniques, such as distribution plots, conditional probabilities, Bayes' theorem, data transformation techniques (such as Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson), and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and applied these to the dataset.
